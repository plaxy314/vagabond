# 朝花夕拾 - Dawn Blossoms Plucked at Dusk

I am a vagabond, wandering freely through different fields of knowledge, ideas, and intellectual pursuits, unbound by discipline or structure.

This blog chronicles my journey to make sense of a seemingly senseless world and find meaning in what often feels like a meaningless life. Along the way, I hope to connect with fellow vagabonds, even if only briefly, before we all vanish into dust.

Wishing you a fantastic day!

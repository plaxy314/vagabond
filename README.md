## 朝花夕拾 - Dawn Blossoms Plucked at Dusk

My fondest childhood memory is discussing physics with my father. By today's standards, my father would not be considered an educated man; he attended only one year of middle school. To make a living, he wandered through various odd jobs—first as a carpenter, then as a chemist in a plywood factory, and finally retiring as an accountant.

My father knew little math, and his understanding of physics was based mostly on intuition. Still, he learned enough to repair radios and television sets. Our family couldn’t afford fancy toys, but that didn’t stop him. He taught me how to build electric motors with copper wires and magnets. These simple creations became my favorite toys, sparking my lifelong fascination with how the world works.

We lived in a neighborhood with an unstable power supply, where dim lights flickered constantly due to voltage fluctuations. One summer, my father and I built a step-up transformer and a rudimentary control panel using scrap components. The steady glow of incandescent bulbs cast a golden hue over our otherwise impoverished life, offering a moment of fleeting comfort.

I was fortunate to attend college and considered pursuing graduate studies in theoretical physics. However, I suffer from some form of dyslexia and cannot fully comprehend equations unless I find a way to visualize them. It's painfully clear that I would have no future in a field increasingly dominated by mathematicians. 

In my senior year, I stumbled upon Francis Crick’s autobiographical book, [_What a Mad Pursuit: A Personal View of Scientific Discovery_](https://www.amazon.com/What-Mad-Pursuit-Scientific-Discovery/dp/0465091385). In it, Crick identified two areas of interest: **the secret of life** and **the workings of the brain**. His lifelong pursuit of these problems intrigued me. Neuroscience, I thought, might be the only frontier of science left for those who are not mathematically gifted.

After college, I enrolled in a joint PhD program at UCSD and the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, hoping to tackle the problem of consciousness. I remember watching an interview where someone asked Crick if it was the right time for young scientists to enter the field. His response has stayed with me:

> I think you have to look at it from their point view and ask, "Will you be able to get grant to study it?" Because they cannot do that, they're not going to get anywhere ... It would be very rash to advise a young person unless he had independent financial means to go into consciousness at this stage. It's all right for me because I can do whatever I like.

This gave me the impression that the established scientific community actually had no idea how to tackle the problem. If they did, they would have already funded the relevant research. I didn’t want to write grant proposals and subject myself to the whims of whoever controls the funding priorities. So, I left the PhD program and joined a software company, hoping to gain the financial means to pursue my own research someday.

But life had other plans. Just months later, 9/11 happened, and the United States tightened national security. My name—a common one among Chinese individuals—somehow landed on the FBI’s blacklist. I couldn’t leave the country or change jobs. For years, I found myself trapped, fighting bureaucrats just to clear my name.

Eventually, I regained my freedom and joined a search company as an engineer. Initially, I worked on machine learning models to classify user-generated content. Later, I was tasked with modeling user behavior to predict ad click-through rates (pCTR) and conversion rates (pCVR). These projects rekindled my interest in science, particularly how the laws of physics govern human behavior.

People tell search engines what they want. By analyzing their queries and online activities, we can infer who they are, where they’ve been, and what they’ve done. This allows us to build user models and predict their behavior, such as whether they will click on an ad, purchase a product, or sign up for a service. 

For the first time in history, it is possible to observe and experiment with billions of users in real time. These pCTR/pCVR models are tested through large-scale online experiments, often involving billions of ad impressions. The predictions are surprisingly accurate, as hundreds of billions of dollars are at stake.

The Ad experiment with human reminds me of the thought experiment with Schrödinger’s cat. The human brain is essentially a sealed box with an unknown mechanism. Such a system can produce two possible outcomes: to be (click) or not to be (click). While we can accurately predict the odds of each outcome, it is impossible to know beforehand what would happen in a given circumstance. 

Moreover, if the subject is aware of being watched, their behavior may change. It seems that the very act of observation inevitably alters the outcome. The striking similarity makes me wonder: Could quantum mechanics have anything to do with the mechanism underlying human behavior?

Unfortunately, _nobody really understands quantum mechanics._ For instance, Max Planck introduced the groundbreaking idea that energy is emitted or absorbed in discrete units called "quanta," but he did not really know why energy must be quantized at the microscopic level.

Albert Einstein successfully explained the photoelectric effect by proposing that light consists of discrete particles called photons, yet he offered no insight into why a photon has a frequency proportional to its energy.

Similarly, Louis de Broglie proposed the idea that matter, like light, exhibits both particle-like and wave-like behavior. However, he did not explain what mechanism underlies the particle-wave duality, and why a particle's wavelength is inversely proportional to its momentum.

Max Born discovered the Born Rule, which states that the square of the absolute value of a particle's complex amplitude is proportional to the probability density of observing that particle. No one knows why this seemingly bizarre rule always works.

Werner Heisenberg realized that certain pairs of physical quantities cannot be measured simultaneously with high accuracy. Yet, he did not elucidate why the uncertainty principle exists.

The list goes on ...

When teaching quantum mechanics at Caltech, Richard Feynman told his students:

> One might still like to ask: “How does it work? What is the machinery behind the law (of quantum mechanics)?” No one has found any machinery behind the law. No one can “explain” any more than we have just “explained.” No one will give you any deeper representation of the situation. We have no ideas about a more basic mechanism from which these results can be deduced.

> *We would like to emphasize a very important difference between classical and quantum mechanics*. We have been talking about the probability that an electron will arrive in a given circumstance. We have implied that in our experimental arrangement (or even in the best possible one) it would be impossible to predict exactly what would happen. We can only predict the odds! This would mean, if it were true, that physics has given up on the problem of trying to predict exactly what will happen in a definite circumstance. Yes! physics has given up. *We do not know how to predict what would happen in a given circumstance*, and we believe now that it is impossible—that the only thing that can be predicted is the probability of different events. 

After conducting numerous ad experiments, I've come to the conclusion that the human brain behaves much like an electron. However, I do not think the underlying mechanism is inherently unknowable. This blog aims to explore that mechanism and the general law that governs both life and the universe.

By today’s standards, I may be labeled a “crackpot”—someone passionate about science yet lacking formal credentials like my father. I prefer "vagabond"—someone wandering freely, unbound by academic or professional paths. 

To me, the essence of human existence lies in the freedom to explore, to challenge, and to seek deeper understanding.
